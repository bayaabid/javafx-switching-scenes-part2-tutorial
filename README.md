JavaFX - Switching Scenes like the Boss! (Part 2) Tutorial

Learn how to DYNAMICALLY switch between JavaFX Scenes without writing any code! 
You can now use an auto-generated Enum to hold your Scene info within you project instead of
maintaining it yourself. See how my custom Maven 3 Plugin which uses the JavaPoet API
can auto-generate the code to get you to switch scenes like a BOSS!

you will need to get the GitHub project "fxml-scanner-maven-plugin-tutorial" build in otder to have the 
maven plugin available for the project.
